    It Ends with Us focuses on Lily Bloom, a young college graduate who moves to Boston and opens her own floral business. She develops feelings for surgeon Ryle Kincaid, who is initially reluctant about having a serious relationship with her. As their relationship blossoms, Lily has a sudden encounter with her first love, Atlas Corrigan. This reintroduction of Atlas threatens her relationship with Ryle and forces her to come to terms with the trauma of her past and present. Lily is forced to make a difficult decision when she is faced with an assault and finds out she is already pregnant with Ryle's child. Atlas initially helps her, but both decide they cannot be around each other casually. Ultimately, Lily decides to leave Ryle for the sake of her newborn baby. She finds it in her heart to co-parent with him. At the novel's conclusion, Lily runs into Atlas, and they restart their relationship.
